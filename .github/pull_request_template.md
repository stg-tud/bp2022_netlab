# Review checklist

(based on the work of Karl E. Wiegers)

**Structure**

- [ ] Does the code completely and correctly implement the design?
- [ ] Does the code conform to any pertinent coding standards?
- [ ] Is the code well-structured, consistent in style, and consistently formatted?
- [ ] Are there any uncalled or unneeded procedures or any unreachable code?
- [ ] Are there any leftover stubs or test routines in the code?
- [ ] Can any code be replaced by calls to external reusable components or library functions?
- [ ] Are there any blocks of repeated code that could be condensed into a single procedure?
- [ ] Is storage use efficient?
- [ ] Are symbolics used rather than “magic number” constants or string constants?
- [ ] Are any modules excessively complex and should be restructured or split into multiple routines?

**Documentation**

- [ ] Is the code clearly and adequately documented with an easy-to-maintain commenting style?
- [ ] Are all comments consistent with the code?

**Variables**

- [ ] Are all variables properly defined with meaningful, consistent, and clear names?
- [ ] Do all assigned variables have proper type consistency or casting?
- [ ] Are there any redundant or unused variables?

**Arithmetic Operations**

- [ ] Does the code avoid comparing floating-point numbers for equality?
- [ ] Does the code systematically prevent rounding errors?
- [ ] Does the code avoid additions and subtractions on numbers with greatly different magnitudes?
- [ ] Are divisors tested for zero or noise?

**Loops and Branches**

- [ ] Are all loops, branches, and logic constructs complete, correct, and properly nested?
- [ ] Are the most common cases tested first in IF- -ELSEIF chains?
- [ ] Are all cases covered in an IF- -ELSEIF or CASE block, including ELSE or DEFAULT clauses?
- [ ] Does every case statement have a default?
- [ ] Are loop termination conditions obvious and invariably achievable?
- [ ] Are indexes or subscripts properly initialized, just prior to the loop?
- [ ] Can any statements that are enclosed within loops be placed outside the loops?
- [ ] Does the code in the loop avoid manipulating the index variable or using it upon exit from the loop?

**Defensive Programming**

- [ ] Are indexes, pointers, and subscripts tested against array, record, or file bounds?
- [ ] Are imported data and input arguments tested for validity and completeness?
- [ ] Are all output variables assigned?
- [ ] Are the correct data operated on in each statement?
- [ ] Is every memory allocation deallocated?
- [ ] Are timeouts or error traps used for external device accesses?
- [ ] Are files checked for existence before attempting to access them?
- [ ] Are all files and devices are left in the correct state upon program termination?
